Spectral line database files containing necessary atomic data for the calculation of line strengths used in radiatively driven winds. Available as both text files and python numpy arrays. The source database is denoted at the bottom of each text file. Line data are compiled from the NIST, CHIANTI, CMFGEN, and TOPbase databases. The websites for these sources are given below.
